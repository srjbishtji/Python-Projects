### 2. **Hints or Range Narrowing**

* After each guess, besides “Too High” or “Too Low,” tell the user the updated possible range.
* For example, if guess was 30 and it’s too low, say “Try a number between 31 and 100.”

### 6. **Difficulty Explanation**

* Print a quick explanation of what easy/medium/hard means (e.g., attempts allowed, number range) before they select.

---

### 7. **GUI Version**

* If you want to go beyond terminal, you can build a simple graphical interface with `tkinter` or similar.

---

### 8. **Sound Effects (if GUI)**
